Project code for java game developed

Game Objective: You are a scientist who has an obsession with discovering more about bananas. Your obsession has brought you into the thick rainforests of Mexico. To your excitement, the rainforest is filled with bananas. However, there is a problem. You're not quite tall enough to reach them... The goal of this game is to collect as many bananas as possible while reaching the exit (black square) in the given time constraint. However, in order to collect the bananas you must first reach the elephant who can help raise you high enough to grab the bananas. Be careful, as their are snakes slithering around all over the ground. One accidental mistep and it's game over.
